Welcome! This is a tool primarily to help Julian collect a dataset. 
<p>
This is for labeling MORAL sentences. This means sentences that imply whether a person is GOOD/RESPECTABLE or EVIL/CONTEMPTUOUS. For example, 
</p>
<br>
| "We empower highly trained reporters with automated speech recognition technology to deliver more accurate transcripts, making attorneys more effective and efficient." 
<br>
<p> 
, implies "We", "reporters" and "attorneys" are all positive, because they are all doing good things worthy of support.

## I appreciate all your help. And now you may read the news for science.

It's still a work in progress so hit me up with suggestions and questions.
